// What to build — which of a product's five pieces a build makes, at what
// quality, optimized or not, and what each costs and takes (client ask,
// 2026-10-22; mockup approved by the owner the same day). Chosen per
// product, before the build, in the What to build panel; a piece left out
// can be added later, from the build review or the product page, and is
// made for what the product already has.
//
// The prices are hypothetical — the owner's to set. Each Quality has its
// own price (owner, 2026-11-01): the PCB, Code and the 3D Module are 1, 2
// or 3 credits at Low, Medium or High; Assembly and Wiring 1 each at any
// level; the Parts list free. The whole product is 5, 8 or 11 credits.
//
// Quality is one choice per product now (owner, 2026-11-01): it starts at
// the level picked on Home with the idea, and the card's Quality menu
// changes it. The panel that picked pieces one by one is hidden for now.
//
// Everything a piece needs is added with it, and taking a piece out takes
// out what needs it, said once in a line: Code and Wiring are made for
// the PCB, and Assembly for the PCB and the 3D Module. The Parts list is not a choice (owner, 2026-10-22): on
// its own it is a list the spec sheet already shows for free, so it comes
// with every build, free, and never alone.
